The birds thrust out their wings but the breeze was all to mild.\nLeaving them to stumble across the earth. So they went to the gorge where the wind showed off its wild and incomparable strength.\nThey threw themselves off the cliff and flapped their wings amongst the howling winds, until they where able to fly freely in the sky.\nTo the Anemo God they went, to gleefully say:\n\'We understand now! All we needed was a stronger wind to fly\'\nIn reply the Anemo God said: \'What you lacked was not wind, but courage. It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world.</string>
