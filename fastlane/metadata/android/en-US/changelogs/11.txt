Changes:
- Qwotable returns to a bottom navigation bar
- Qwotable's home screen now shows the favorites on it

New:
- In the home screen, there is a card for random quotes, that is currently only working in English
- A long awaited feature: Qwotable finally has an app widget that shows random quotes of Qwotable's database
- Qwotable does now work offline too. Qwotables are now downloaded. If there is an update for the data, Qwotable will inform the user
