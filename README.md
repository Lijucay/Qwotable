Qwotable is currently sunset. Development is paused and it is unclear when it will be continued

# Qwotable
Qwotable is a simple Android application filled with quotable stuff. Besides its own content, it provides 6 different APIs and one additional extra dataset.

> [!caution]
> Qwotable does no longer work for any versions below Version 2.0. That includes any previously published apks, for example on FDroid. Currently, Qwotables newest version is not added to FDroid, I need to check what happened there. For now, you can install the release on GitHub. Thank you for your patience.
