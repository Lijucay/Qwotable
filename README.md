# Qwotable
Qwotable is a simple Android application filled with quotable stuff. Besides its own content, it provides 6 different APIs and one additional extra dataset.

> [!caution]
> Qwotable's functionality is currently not existing. There has been huge changes on how Qwotable deals with the data. A connection to online data is not possible due to changes of the username. Please stay patient for a new update, that fixes the issue
