# Qwotable

Qwotable is an Android application with quotable stuff.

Qwotable differentiates between two different kinds of quotable stuff:

## 1. Quotes
- With quotes, I mean short passages that are easy to remember and to use. Often quotes have a deep meaning, but there are quotes that have no deep meaning as well.
(e.g. It's funny, because it's true [from: Solitaire by: Alice Oseman])

## 2. Wisdom
- In this App, wisdom are longer passages. In Qwotable, wisdom always teach you of something. They are harder to remember thus sometimes, it is not only one person's view.

Qwotables very own wiki explains the criteria of quotes and wisdom.
