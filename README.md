# Important note:
> [!caution]
> Development of Qwotable has officially **ended**. Over the years I’ve learned a lot, and the current codebase has reached a point where it’s no longer maintainable.
>
> But this isn’t the end, I’m rewriting the app from scratch and will release it under a new name. In a final update, you’ll have the option to back up your data and bring it into the new app. While I can’t guarantee that everything (like favorites) will transfer perfectly, I’ll do my best to make the migration as smooth as possible.
> 
> Thank you for using Qwotable and for supporting me along the way. I’m excited to share the next version with you soon!
